 This code  focuses on predicting the future evolution of vegetation cover
 in Tunisia using advanced machine learning methods. The study concentrates on
 analyzing climatic and environmental data to understand the impact of climate
 change on Tunisian forest ecosystems. The code details the processes of data
 extraction, processing, and analysis, as well as the use of various machine learning
 models and algorithms, such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVM. These models
 are trained on the available data and tailored to our specific problem to provide
 accurate future predictions. Each model is evaluated based on its predictive
 performance to select the one that offers the best accuracy and overall performance.
